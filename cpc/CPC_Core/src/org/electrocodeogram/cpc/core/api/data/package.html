Contains interface specifications for the CPC clone data objects.
<p>
The interfaces in this package define the root of the CPC clone data elements.
{@link org.electrocodeogram.cpc.core.api.data.ICloneDataElement} is the top most super-interface which encompasses all other interfaces.
<p>
Care should be taken to fully understand the interface hierarchy before providing
a custom implementation of these interfaces.
<br>
Especially the interfaces within the {@link org.electrocodeogram.cpc.core.api.data.collection} package
are important.
<p>
A default implementation is provided by the <em>CPC Store</em> module.
<br>
Instances which implement these interfaces can be obtained from the
{@link org.electrocodeogram.cpc.core.api.provider.data.ICloneFactoryProvider}.
