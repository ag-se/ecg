1. [EclipseSensor.java : 206-208] Is it redundant to have temporary variable 
    "textEditor"?
    (OK) <Fixed>

2. [EclipseSensor.java : 375] The setSensorProperties() is not called anywhere.
    What's it for? It changes the sensorshell() at run time. Any reason for it?
    (Yes, to support the piemontese plugin. Add this to the javadoc.) <OK>
    
3. [EclipseSensor.java : 538] In case of the exception the error message will 
    be printed out silently in the background. Can we use logging function?
    (print to log file accessed via sensorshell.)
    <fixed - sending Exception message to general pupose Hackystat logger>
    
4. [EclipseSensor.java : 821] The comment tells that it can not be called by the 
    client. You may claim it as package private.
    (If only called by EclipseSensorPlugin, then can be package private.)
   <"Cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method from IResourceDeltaVisitor"> 
    
5. [EclipseSensor.java : 104] The name of activeBuffer is not saying what it 
    represents. activeBufferSize will be good. 
    (OK)
    <fixed>
    
6. [EclipseSensor.java : 131] As my understanding you don't need this variable 
    any more?
    (Nope, is needed in setSensorProperties.)
    <ok>
    
7. One question on how the sensor works. I am using the dual monitor and my habit
   is to open two more Eclipse windows. The EclipseSensor is a synchronized singleton
   instance. Will I get one instance only or two instance when after use "windows| 
   open window" to open a new Eclispe window? Will it affect the eclipse sensor?
   (Good question. I claim this is busted.)
   <to be fixed at a later time.>
