Code Review of Eclipse Sensor by Joy Agustin

1. [EclipseSensor.java:73,75] I think use of the <code> tags are useful to
   emphasize the method names, but I think you might have fogotten the </code>
   closing tags.  Also, I'm not sure what value is added to the JavaDoc by
   adding descriptions of the methods at the class level this way.  Right now
   it looks like the comments should be placed at the method level.
   (Agreed, get rid of method docs at class level.)
   <fixed - deleted all method descriptions>
   
2. [EclipseSensor.java:285, 304, 318, 342, 394] Inconsistent use of
   this.shell.doCommand(), doCommand(), and this.doCommand().
   (OK)
   <fixed>
   
3. [EclipseSensor.java:416] Not sure why you would need a
   removeEclipseSensorEventListener method?
   (OK)
   <done>
   
4. [Ramblings of a confused person] Can't remember if anyone ever mentioned this
   before, but I was looking though my Hackystat data and I noticed that
   sometimes I have 3 or 4 "Browser activated" data in a row within a short
   period of time:
   
Mon Jun 30 13:26:24 HST 2003 Eclipse State Change C:/cvs/hackyEclipse/doc/review/0630-jagustin.txt
Mon Jun 30 13:27:16 HST 2003 Eclipse Unknown Browser activated
Mon Jun 30 13:28:12 HST 2003 Eclipse Unknown Browser activated
Mon Jun 30 13:28:29 HST 2003 Eclipse Unknown Browser activated
Mon Jun 30 13:28:39 HST 2003 Eclipse Open File C:/cvs/hackyEclipse/src/org/hackystat/stdext/sensor/eclipse/event/IEclipseSensorEventListener.java
   
   For example, above my browser was activated 3 times in little over a minute.
   Would it be possible to gather data to tell me what file is active just
   before my browser was not active and then tell me what file is active when my
   my browser is reactivated (like a before and after)?  Perhaps with this data
   Hackystat can figure out what people's programming habits are?  (From the
   above example, we can all guess that I was doing this code review.)  But
   perhaps this wouldn't work because it would also require knowing what a
   person did while they were "away" from the browser.  Or perhaps I'm just
   trying to find something that isn't there.
   (Get rid of recording these browser events, there is no useful information provided.)
   <removed the "browser activated" and the "browser closing" messages>
