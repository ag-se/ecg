Code Review for the Hacky Eclipse code by Aaron Kagawa

1. [org.hackystat.stdext.sensor.eclipse.EclipseSensorTimeTask.java]

   This timer task seems to have a mystery Timer for it.  I can only assume that
   the SensorShell provides the Timer class.  But, I would guess that some one
   new to this code would have no idea.
   
1.1.  EclipseSensor.java:175-187]. This must be a method that is called in
two places: the constructor, when the sensor.properties files is found, or
in setSensorProperties, when a new sensor is set up (via Piemontese). You
must guarantee that the same exact code will run in both situations. Maybe
rename "setSensorProperties" to something like "initializeSensor" (or create
a new method called initializeSensor that gets called in the two places.)
<fixed - up for beta testing>

2. [org.hackystat.stdext.sensor.eclipse.event.IEclipseSensorEventListener.java]

   I couldn't find another class that implements this interface.  That is a little confusing.

   The javadoc states the following (below).  I am a little confused at where this code would go or what
   it would be used for (is it for the Piemontese Elipse Sensor)?
   Also, "EclipseSensor.EclipseSensor.SENSOR_ECLIPSE" is wrong.

 * <p>Whenever a new sensor properties is supposed to be read in Eclipse sensor, you must set the
 * new sensor properties in such a way that :
 *
 * <pre>
 * File sensorPropertiesFile = new File(...);
 * SensorProperties newProperties = new SensorProperties(EclipseSensor.EclipseSensor.SENSOR_ECLIPSE,
 * sensorPropertiesFile);
 * EclipseSensor.getInstance().setSensorProperties(newProperties);
 
 (Probably OK, needed for piemontese sensor.)
