  <P> 
  <LI><STRONG>Nov 7, 2002</STRONG><br>
    - Changes: 
    <UL>
      <LI>Better performance on Eclipse Start up. Penetrates lazy instantiation 
        so that the status, in which either active file exists in the text editor 
        on startup, browser is de-activate, or any editor part is clicked, would 
        instantiate Eclipse sensor. This would avoid sensor form being initialized 
        in the situation in which user just opens Eclipse IDE, but do nothing. 
      </LI>
      <LI>Part to listen to the selection listener. Instead, listens to the part 
        listener for an active file and opened files. </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI></P>

  <LI><STRONG>Oct 30, 2002</STRONG><br>

        of platform was clicked.</LI>
      <LI>Part in which threads created two instances when EclipseSensor.getInstance 
        was initially called.<BR>
        Fixed it, synchoronizing the class on initial call.</LI>
      <LI>Part in which sensor recorded empty absolute path although there existed 
        no active file.</LI>
      <LI>Part in which sensor recorded the previous active file although there 
        existed not active file.</LI>
