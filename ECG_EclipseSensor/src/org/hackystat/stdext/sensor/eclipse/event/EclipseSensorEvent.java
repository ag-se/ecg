/**
 * Provides a event information (flag) and IResource instance if applicable. A client
 * of the Eclipse Sensor should not instantiate this instance. IResource instance is given at 
 * the resource place where the EclipseSensorEventListener is hooked.
 * 
 * <p>The IResource instance can be used when the following flag is contained.
 * <ul>
 * <li>PROJECT_OPEN - A project is opened. IResource can cast IProject.</li>
 * <li>PROJECT_CLOSE - A project is closed. IResource can cast IProject.</li>
 * <li>FILE_SAVE - A file is saved. IResource can cast IFile.</li>
 * 
 * After getting IResource instance, using <code>getResource()</code>, the client
 * might manipulate the project path and/or workspace path, and so forth.
 * 
 * <p>Otherwise the IResource instance is null.
