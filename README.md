# README #

This repository is a backup from BerliOS svn repository. It was created using the following procedure:
 
* `git svn clone svn://svn.berlios.de/ecg --stdlayout`
* manually created tags on master branch based on history of "tags" folder

### Further remarks ###

* there were no branches in the repository
* all commit messages contain the original SVN revision number
* some commits are empty because Git does not support empty directories (and their deletion and creation)
* there are only the original SVN user names, no real names or e-mail addresses
 * get in contact if you want to claim yours; since there is no active development,
   the Git history can be rewritten to include more meta-data
