* `git svn clone svn://svn.berlios.de/ecg --stdlayout`
* manually created tags on master branch based on history of "tags" folder

### Further remarks ###

* there were no branches in the repository
* all commit messages contain the original SVN revision number
* some commits are empty because Git does not support empty directories (and their deletion and creation)
