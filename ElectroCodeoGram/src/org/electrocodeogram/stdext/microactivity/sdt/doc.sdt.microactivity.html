The Activity sensor data type represents timestamped developer activities
such as compiling or editing a file.  Its attributes are:
<ul>
  <li> tstamp: The UTC time at which this data was collected.
  <li> tool: A string indicating the tool that generated this metric data, 
       such as "Emacs" or "JBuilder".
  <li> type: The type of activity, such as "Close File" or "State Change". 
       See org.hackystatx.sdt.activity.ActivityType for details.
  <li> data: A string containing supplemental data concerning this activity,
       such as the file involved in it.
</ul> 
Currently, the most important type of Activity is the "State Change" event,
which indicates that the developer was actively working on the specified
file at that point in time.  Activity data is normally collected via a sensor
attached to the developer's interactive development environment, such as
Emacs, JBuilder, or Eclipse.
<p>
The Daily Analysis for this SDT computes, for each five minute interval,
the total number of activities that occurred during this interval.
Activity events are
also used as a basis for the "Most Active File" Daily Analysis. This
analysis collects together the "State Change" events occuring during each
five minute interval, and whichever file is associated with the most State
Change events is the Most Active File for that five minute interval.
