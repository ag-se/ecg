Implements the Activity sensor data type, 
which represents timestamped developer activities
such as compiling or editing a file.  The most important Activity instance
is the "State Change" event, which indicates that the developer was
actively working on the specified file at that point in time.  Activity
instances are normally collected via a sensor attached to the developer's
interactive development environment, such as Emacs or JBuilder.
