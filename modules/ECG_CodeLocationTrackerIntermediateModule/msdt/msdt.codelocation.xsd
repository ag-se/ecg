			This XML schema defines the structure of the "code location" MicroSensorDataType.
			It describes a change or birth of a code location computed from code changes.
			The elements are (version 1):
			commonData - As usual, mainly taken from the corresponding codediff events
			path - An indicator of where in a hierarchy of location this location is located.
			       The format is not definied in version 1. It is empty or missing.
			type - Kind of metamorphosis of this location:
				   * INTIATED = No history available, first compution without a diff
				   * ADDED = Newly introduced location due to inserted lines
				   * CHANGED = The contents of the location has changed without inserted or deleted lines
				   * MERGED_DEL_AT_START = The location has been merged with the previous one and has been removed
				   * MERGED_DEL_AT_END = The location has been merged with the subsequent one and has been removed
				   * MERGED_ADD_AT_START = The location has been merged with the previous one and has been retained
				   * MERGED_ADD_AT_END = The location has been merged with the subsequent one and has been retained
				   * EXTENDED_AT_START = The location has been extended at the beginning due to inserted lines
				   * EXTENDED_IN_BETWEEN = the location has been extended in the middle of it due to inserted lines
				   * EXTENDED_AT_END = The location has been extended at the end due to inserted lines
				   * SPLIT_DEL_AT_START = The location has been shortened in the beginning because a new location has been built
				   * SPLIT_DEL_AT_END = The location has been shortened at the ned because a new location has been built
				   * SPLIT_ADD_AT_START = This location has been created because its a split from the end of another location
				   * SPLIT_ADD_AT_END = This location has been created because its a split from the beginning of another location
				   * SHORTENED_AT_ALL = The location has been completely deleted due to deleted lines
				   * SHORTENED_AT_START = The location has been shortened in the beginning due to deleted lines
				   * SHORTENED_IN_BETWEEN = The location has been shortened in the middle of it due to deleted lines
				   * SHORTENED_AT_END = The location has been shortened at the end due to deleted lines
			id - The unique id of the location
			related - An id of another location. Some of the metamorphosis types involve another location; this is the id of it.
			location - A string denoting the position of the location in the project. 
			           In version 1 it has the form "filename;startline;length". length is the number of lines
			properties - A string representing some properties of the location change
			             In version 1 the format is not sepcified. It is empty or missing.
			contents - The code fragments of the latest microversion of this location, i.e. the results of the metamorphosis, the changed contents of the location
