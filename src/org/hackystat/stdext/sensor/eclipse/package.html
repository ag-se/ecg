Provides the main implementation of the Eclipse IDE sensor.

<p><code>EclipseSensorPlugin</code> is the implementation class for Eclipse IDE plugin, 
 whose main purpose is to instantiate <code>EclipseSensor</code> class.
 
<p><code>EclipseSensor</code> instantiates sensor shell to collect necessary data such as
active file information, file metric information. Provides public process methods such as
<code>processActivity</code>, <code>processStateChangeActivity</code>, <code>processFileMetric</code>,
and <code>processUnitTest</code>.

<p><code>StateChangeTimerTask</code> runs to process state change and file metric in a certain
interval. <code>BuffTransTimerTask</code> runs to process buffer transitions in a certain interval.

<p> Currently, Three threshold values are manipulated by the sensor:
<ol>
  <li>Activity : The activity time is captured if a ceratain event asociated with
    acitivity is triggered. For the most frequentry threshold is state change
    acitivity. It is captured if there exisst unstored buffer in the text file.
  <li>FileMetric : The metrics are calculated such as CK metrics.
  <li>UnitTest : The JUnit test results are captured if the JUnit test cases or
    suites are executed in the JUnit pane of the Eclipse.
  <li>BuffTrans : The buffer transitions are captured if the current buffer is visiting a file and
     if that file is different from the file visited by the buffer during the last wakeup.
</ol>
The determination of these three threshold values are set in the <code>sensor.properties</code>
file.

<p> For instructions on how to install these sensors in your Eclipse IDE, see
  the web page installation instructions at a running Hackystat server.
